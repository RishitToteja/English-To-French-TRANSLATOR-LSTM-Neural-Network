# English-To-French-TRANSLATOR-LSTM-Neural-Network

In this project, built and trained a seq2seq model with Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) to perform English to French translation. 
Pandas and numpy was used for preprocessing data and Natural language Processing Toolkit (NLTK) was used for a) Tokenizing, b) Conversion to numbers and, c) Padding the text data. These numbers were then used to train the Machine Learning Model to make predictions.
For builiding the LSTM network, we used Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras API. We build a sequential (Encoder-Decoder) model. For the encoder used LSTM network and and another LSTM network for decoder.
The results of the model were as follows :
1) Accuracy (Training Data) : 
2) Accuracy (Test Data) : 
3) Validation Accuracy : 

This project could be very useful as a communication tool to help travelers or people who are either settling into or visiting a new country.
